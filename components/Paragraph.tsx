            For my final project, I am working with Isaac Walter and we are planning on making a basic calorie counter app.
            We are planning on using an API that has food nutrition data, so the user can input a food that they ate
            and it pulls the calories from it as well as the macros and records it. The user can set a desired daily goal,
            and it will show the % they are to their goal.
